# Stathopoulos_Lab

#### This github repository includes ChIPSeq, ATACSseq, and RNASeq data processing pipelines for a research article [Odd-paired is a late-acting pioneer factor coordinating with Zelda to broadly regulate gene expression in early embryos](https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.59610).  
#### The codes can be used under UNIX(Centos/Ubuntu) environment with proper installation of necessary software tools.
